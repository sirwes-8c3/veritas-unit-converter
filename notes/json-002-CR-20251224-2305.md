# AI Code Review: json-002

**Date:** 2025-12-24
**Reviewer:** Antigravity (AI)

## Status
**PASSED**

## 1. Architectural Alignment
- **JSON Structure**: The `conversions.json` file perfectly matches the schema defined in `specs/01-overview.md` and `specs/json-002.md`.
- **Model Compatibility**: The keys provided (`id`, `name`, `symbol`, `toBase`, `toBaseOffset`) align exactly with the `Unit` struct requirements in `specs/models-001.md`.
- **Data Driven**: Explicitly including `toBaseOffset: 0` for linear conversions is a good practice for data consistency, even though the decoder handles the optionality.

## 2. Best Practices & Performance
- **Precision**: The affine coefficients for Fahrenheit are provided with high precision (10 decimal places), ensuring accurate conversion results. Verified against freezing (32°F -> 273.15K) and boiling (212°F -> 373.15K) points.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The implementation is strictly data (JSON), keeping logic out as requested.

## 3. Issues & Recommendations
- **[INFO]**: No issues found. The implementation is comprehensive and accurate to the specifications.
